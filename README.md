# Image-classification-using-CNN-Convolution-Neural-Netork-

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
We build Convolution neural network model to classify some large set of images of dogs and cats. Here, we will train a Convolution neural network to predict if the image is a photo of a dog or cat.
